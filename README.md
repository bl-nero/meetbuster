# MeetBuster

This is a simple Chrome extension that turns Google Calendar's week view into a Breakout clone. This was simply made for fun after hours, and as it is, it represents an absolute disregard to good programming practices. But hey, it works, and it's still the most elaborate joke I've ever pulled off.

## Installation

Just go to the [official extension page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/meetbuster/khkjjbiflncechkcipbbkehlceoiigcd).

## Building

Actually, there's nothing to be built. It's all just raw JavaScript. Making it properly modularized would just spoil the fun, right? If you want to fiddle with it, just enable the developer mode in chrome://extensions/ and load an unpacked extension from this directory.
